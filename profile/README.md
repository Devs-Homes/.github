# 💙 Devs' Homes
Devs’ Homes is a free social network for developers. It’s a safe space to share your latest projects, share code, ask questions, and just be yourself. While it is currently in development and far from finished, our PEEP program will be available soon.

# 🏠 Why is it called Devs' *Homes?*
It's not called Devs' Homes for nothing. You see, your profile is your *home*. You can decorate it, pin things on your wall, and make it your own, just like you would any house. If you're not feeling quite at home, try messing around with your settings by going to `Account > Settings > Profile > Home`.

# 🪲 PEEP?
Public Experimental Enrollment Program (PEEP). We'd love to hear what you think about Devs' Homes, so very soon, we'll open PEEP to anyone who wants to see experimental (and possibly buggy!) versions. It'll be an exciting experience for both us and our volunteers, so make sure to join when it's available! We will have sources you can get notified about what we do soon. When we create those, they'll be listed on this page.

# 👩‍💻 Can I join the development team?
If you think you have what it takes! We'd love to interview you and see if you're a good fit for the team. When developer applications are open, we'll let you know how you can enroll.

Happy programming! 💙
